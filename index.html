            <p>Fast rising rapper and artist bliss kushman has finally shared his thoughts on the raging issues regarding the death of our home made genre gengetone.</p>
            <p>Which is thought to have gone extinct in his latest song dubbed Gengetone featuring fellow artists , Paka and Makaveli.</p><br>
            <p>Bliss has been on upward trend musically due to his ability to horn and mix humour , story telling and rapping craft in the national Swahili language make his songs easy to follow and 
                get both the bigger and small picture.</p> <br>
            <p>This can be witnessed in his past bangers such as After Corona , Zilizopendwa , Tumewachana (formerly CRUSH) , his viral song on TikTok Nawacha Pombe and now Gengetone Is Not Dead.</p>

            <p>Gengetone which is produced by Hitman Khat, follows the trio rappers as they give a triology to how the gengetone genre which debuted in 2018 rose and continues to dominate arguing that
                it can't be said to have died as it has artists consistently releasing music.</p>
            <p>To them gengetone continues to receive millions of views and a multitude of fans who still support the genre , and thus classifying the genre as dead is an abuse to those who still support it.</p>

                <p><em>"Thus Kenyans, should focus on instead giving it the mainstream support it needs to thrive, rather than purport it to be dead for it's the only home made music to burgeon, after the fall of kapuka & genge..."</em> Bliss Kushman.</p>
